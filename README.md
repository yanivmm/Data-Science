This repository contains Python scripts.
All scripts are displayed in jupyter lab, Which means it's really easy to follow .
Most of the scripts here deal with data Science and one that deals with computer vision.


For the in-depth:
You can see that I am building automated software for data analysis and I am refining it as I progress through the scripts.
Hopefully the software will be completed in the coming year, then all the relevant information will be displayed in one click.

Thank you!
